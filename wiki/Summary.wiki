OK, there's some code.  Just the parser so far, which uses the [http://code.google.com/p/castaliadelphiparser Castalia] delphi code parser.

Now, what is this all about?  I am a Delphi developer (among other things) and found using the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pascalmock/ PascalMock] library a bit of a chore.  There was a *lot* of boilerplate code required.  So, this project was born.

For now, I'm leeching off the good folks at Google, getting them to keep track of my TODO list.  I'll pay them back with source soon.
