Summary of the delphi-mock-wizard project.

= Introduction =

OK, firstly, there's no code yet.  You may have noticed.  I have it, but I need to tidy it up before I post it.  Please be patient.

Now, what is this all about?  I am a Delphi developer (among other things) and found using the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pascalmock/ PascalMock] library a bit of a chore.  There was a *lot* of boilerplate code required.  So, this project was born.

For now, I'm leeching off the good folks at Google, getting them to keep track of my TODO list.  I'll pay them back with source soon.
