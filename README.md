# delphi-mock-wizard

Designed to work with PascalMock (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pascalmock/)

I found that generating mocks for PascalMock was tiresome, manual and error-prone. So I wrote this IDE plugin to do the job for me.
Give it an interface, and it will generate a mock for you.

PascalMock and Delphi-Mock-Wizard are old libraries now - if you are using Delphi XE@ or later, you are probably better off looking at Vincent Parrett's DelphiMocks library (https://github.com/VSoftTechnologies/Delphi-Mocks)
